# About Me

My name is Steven, but I often go by the alias/username "zzApotheosis"! If you're wondering why I picked that username of all possible choices, I learned about the word apotheosis from a rather violent, but entertaining web series called ["Madness Combat"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbitqTpQb78). I then decided to create an Xbox Live gamertag based on that word, so I tried to take "Apotheosis" but it was already taken... I slapped a "z" on the front of it to make "zApotheosis" but that was already taken too. I slapped one last "z" on the front of it to create "zzApotheosis" and that's the one I claimed successfully. That was in 2011 and I'm still sticking with it.

I'm a software engineer, electrical engineer, computer scientist, firearms enthusiast, novice gunsmith, motorcycle rider, Christian, GNU/Linux/FLOSS enthusiast, sysadmin, gamer, weeb, American, moderate libertarian, and sometimes a dummy! I hold a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering Technology from the Metropolitan State University of Denver with a GPA of 3.37. I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science, specializing in Computing Systems from the Georgia Institute of Technology.

[Master Pope's dream](https://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/vim-koans/)

Master Pope once dreamt he was an Emacs user. When he awoke, he exclaimed:

"I do not know if I am Tim Pope dreaming I am an Emacs user, or an Emacs user dreaming I am Tim Pope!"

[Master Wq and the Unix master](https://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/vim-koans/)

An old Unix master came to Master Wq. "I am troubled, Wq. You teach the way of Vim. vi is holy but Vim is not; its code sprawls, its features crowd memory; its binaries are vast, its behavior inconsistent. This is not the way of Unix. I fear you mislead your students. What can be done?"

Master Wq nodded. "You are right," he said. "Vim is broken. Let us fix it. Shall we begin?"

The old Unix master agreed, and opened a shell. He typed:

```$ vi vim.c```

He began to code. Master Wq watched for a while and then asked him, "Which implementation of vi are you using? Nvi? Vim? Elvis?"

"I don't know," said the Unix master. "It doesn't matter."

Master Wq nodded. The Unix master sat stunned for a moment and closed his document unsaved.

## Music

NOTE: This section is a work-in-progress. I'll need time to remember all the gorgeous music I've heard over the years.

I was one of the few blessed individuals whose parents forced them to join band/orchestra throughout my early school years even though I didn't want to. Having been exposed to musicianship from such a young age has given me a pure and deep appreciation for music which I believe can't be expressed by people who haven't experienced band, orchestra, choir, or some other organized ensemble. In my opinion, music is the greatest form of art that can be experienced.

With that being said, this is a list of my favorite songs of all time.
- Owl City - Fireflies
- John Rzeznik - I'm Still Here
- The Midnight - Lost Boy
- The Midnight - America 2
- The Midnight - Los Angeles
- Tracy Chapman - Fast Car
- Cheap Trick - The Flame
- The Strike - Through the Silence
- Midnight Kids - Find Our Way (Night Drive Edit)
- Midnight Kids - 405
- Tom Petty - Learning to Fly
- Coldplay - The Scientist
- NF & Cordae - CAREFUL
- deadmau5 - The Veldt
- Owl City - Lonely Lullaby

Additionally, these are my favorite musical artists of all time.
- Adam Young (Owl City)
- The Midnight
- Midnight Kids
- The Strike
- NF
- Skrillex

## Motorcycles

I've been a rider since 2018. I currently don't ride, but I used to own a 2013 Honda CBR500R. It was a fun bike! I laid it over once and got some gnarly road rash and my wrist still feels a tiny bit funky but I have no regrets. One day, I'd love to own a liter bike and I've got my eyes on Yamaha's R1.

## Firearms

Unfortunately, all of my weapons were lost in a tragic boating accident, and I regret to publicly inform everybody that due to the rapidly changing currents of the Atlantic ocean, it is extremely unlikely that those weapons will ever be recovered, except by archaeologists centuries, if not millenia from now.

Tinfoil-hat-jokes aside, I own a Glock 43X as my concealed carry weapon and a Glock 17 as my standard size handgun. I purchased a [Palmetto State Armory PSAK-47 GF5](https://palmettostatearmory.com/ak-47/psak-47-gf5.html) as well and made some minor modifications to it and it has been such a pleasure to shoot. I also own a Ruger 57, a 12ga Benelli Supernova, and a Bergara B-14 chambered in .30-06.

Disclaimer: Firearms are **NOT** toys and should never be considered as such. I condemn irresponsible firearms handling. [According to the National Rifle Association](https://gunsafetyrules.nra.org/), the three fundamental rules for safe firearms handling are:
- **ALWAYS** keep the gun pointed in a safe direction
- **ALWAYS** keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot
- **ALWAYS** keep the gun unloaded until ready to use

Follow these simple rules, and nearly every firearms-related accident can be prevented.
