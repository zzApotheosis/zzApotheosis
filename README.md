# About Me

My name is Steven, but I often go by the alias/username "zzApotheosis"! If you're wondering why I picked that username of all possible choices, I learned about the word apotheosis from a rather violent, but entertaining web series called ["Madness Combat"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbitqTpQb78). I then decided to create an Xbox Live gamertag based on that word, so I tried to take "Apotheosis" but it was already taken... I slapped a "z" on the front of it to make "zApotheosis" but that was already taken too. I slapped one last "z" on the front of it to create "zzApotheosis" and that's the one I claimed successfully. That was in 2011 and I'm still sticking with it.

I'm a software engineer, electrical engineer, computer scientist, firearms enthusiast, novice gunsmith, motorcycle rider, Christian, GNU/Linux/FLOSS enthusiast, sysadmin, gamer, weeb, American, moderate libertarian, and sometimes a dummy! I hold a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering Technology from the Metropolitan State University of Denver with a GPA of 3.37. I hope to pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science before I turn 30!

I suppose most folks would consider the hottest current celebrity to be their idol. As a technologist and a F/LOSS advocate, Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds, and RDML Grace Hopper are my heroes. I highly encourage others to choose their role models wisely. While I realize that even publicly saying this is one of the nerdiest things I can possibly do, I still find it extremely important to promote lesser-known, highly influential, thankless individuals.

I have always been an avid learner. I enjoy learning about anything and everything I can. But I also find time to kick back and indulge in less-productive hobbies as well! I believe a healthy mind needs periodic breaks and playtime.

## Motorcycles

I've been a rider since 2018. I currently don't ride, but I used to own a 2013 Honda CBR500R. It was a fun bike! I laid it over once and got some gnarly road rash and my wrist still feels a tiny bit funky but I have no regrets. One day, I'd love to own a liter bike and I've got my eyes on Yamaha's R1.

## Firearms

Unfortunately, all of my weapons were lost in a tragic boating accident, and I regret to publicly inform everybody that due to the rapidly changing currents of the Atlantic ocean, it is extremely unlikely that those weapons will ever be recovered, except by archaeologists centuries, if not millenia from now.

Tinfoil-hat-jokes aside, I own a Glock 43X as my concealed carry weapon and a Glock 17 as my standard size handgun. I purchased a [Palmetto State Armory PSAK-47 GF5](https://palmettostatearmory.com/ak-47/psak-47-gf5.html) as well and made some minor modifications to it and it has been such a pleasure to shoot. I also own a Ruger 57, a 12ga Benelli Supernova, and a Bergara B-14 chambered in .30-06.

Disclaimer: Firearms are **NOT** toys and should never be considered as such. I condemn irresponsible firearms handling. [According to the National Rifle Association](https://gunsafetyrules.nra.org/), the three fundamental rules for safe firearms handling are:
- **ALWAYS** keep the gun pointed in a safe direction
- **ALWAYS** keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot
- **ALWAYS** keep the gun unloaded until ready to use

Follow these simple rules, and nearly every firearms-related accident can be prevented.
