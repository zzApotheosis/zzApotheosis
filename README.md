# About Me

My name is Steven, but I often go by the moniker/alias/pseudonym/username "zzApotheosis"! If you're wondering why I picked that username of all possible choices, I learned about the word apotheosis from a rather violent, but entertaining web series called ["Madness Combat"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbitqTpQb78). I then decided to create an Xbox Live gamertag based on that word, so I tried to take "Apotheosis" but it was already taken... I slapped a "z" on the front of it to make "zApotheosis" but that was already taken too! I slapped one last "z" on the front of it to create "zzApotheosis" and that's the one I claimed successfully. That was in 2011 and I'm still sticking with it.

I'm a software engineer, electrical engineer, computer scientist, firearms enthusiast, motorcycle rider, Christian, GNU/Linux/FLOSS enthusiast, gamer, partial weeaboo, American, libertarian, and a dumbass! I hold a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering Technology from the Metropolitan State University of Denver with a GPA of 3.37. I hope to pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science before I turn 30!

# Connect with me!

GitHub is probably my favorite place to hang out, simply for the sake of always being exposed to new things to learn about computer science, but you can connect with me elsewhere as well!
