# About Me

My name is Steven, but I often go by the moniker/alias/pseudonym/username "zzApotheosis"! If you're wondering why I picked that username of all possible choices, I learned about the word apotheosis from a rather violent, but entertaining web series called ["Madness Combat"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbitqTpQb78). I then decided to create an Xbox Live gamertag based on that word, so I tried to take "Apotheosis" but it was already taken... I slapped a "z" on the front of it to make "zApotheosis" but that was already taken too! I slapped one last "z" on the front of it to create "zzApotheosis" and that's the one I claimed successfully. That was in 2011 and I'm still sticking with it.

I'm a software engineer, electrical engineer, computer scientist, firearms enthusiast, motorcycle rider, Christian, GNU/Linux/FLOSS enthusiast, sysadmin, gamer, weeb, American, moderate libertarian, and sometimes a dummy! I hold a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering Technology from the Metropolitan State University of Denver with a GPA of 3.37. I hope to pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science before I turn 30!

# Personal

I have always been an avid learner. I enjoy learning about anything and everything I can. But I also find time to kick back and indulge in less-productive hobbies as well! I believe a healthy mind needs periodic breaks and playtime.

## Motorcycles

I've been a rider since 2018. Currently I ride a 2013 Honda CBR500R. It's a fun bike, but I'm looking to purchase a brand new liter bike when the time is right!

## Firearms

Unfortunately, all of my weapons were lost in a tragic boating accident, and I regret to publicly inform everybody that due to the rapidly changing currents of the Atlantic ocean, it is extremely unlikely that those weapons will ever be recovered, except by archaeologists centuries, if not millenia from now.

Tinfoil-hat-jokes aside, I own a Glock 43X as my concealed carry weapon. I assembled my own AR-15 from scratch and it shoots like a dream! I have AR-9 and AR-10 parts on the way as well, but they've been "shipping" for like 5 months now, so who knows when or if those will ever arrive?

Disclaimer: Firearms are **NOT** toys and should never be considered as such. I condemn irresponsible firearms handling. [According to the National Rifle Association](https://gunsafetyrules.nra.org/), the three fundamental rules for safe firearms handling are:
- **ALWAYS** keep the gun pointed in a safe direction
- **ALWAYS** keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot
- **ALWAYS** keep the gun unloaded until ready to use

GitHub is probably my favorite place to hang out, simply for the sake of always being exposed to new things to learn about computer science, but you can connect with me elsewhere as well!
